<h1>Food</h1>
<br />
<p>
  Sometimes cities have a food that is all their own: the Philly Cheesesteak, Chicago-Style pizza, a Primanti Brothers sandwich in Pittsburgh. Well in Minneapolis we have the <span class="strong">Jucy Lucy</span> (or Juicy Lucy depending on who you ask). When everyone else was foolishly putting cheese on top of their burgers, a brave Minneapolitan said, "No....that is wrong" and put the cheese <span class="strong">inside</span> (!) the burger (whaaaaaat!)
</p>
<br />
<p>
  Accounts differ as to who that actually was, but the three favorite places to get them are at <span class="content-link"><%= link_to "Matt's Bar", "http://www.mattsbar.com/index-1.html"%></span> (Minneapolis), the <span class="content-link"><%= link_to "5-8 Club", "http://www.5-8club.com/"%></span> (Minneapolis), and <span class="content-link"><%= link_to "The Nook", "http://www.crnook.com/"%></span> (St. Paul). None of these places is super close to downtown, unfortunately, so you may not be able to go unless you have some extra time to explore (and maybe a car). BUT, there are plenty of places <span class="content-link"><%= link_to "downtown", "http://www.yelp.com/search?find_desc=juicy+lucy&find_loc=Downtown+Minneapolis,+Minneapolis,+MN", target: "_blank" %></span> where you can try one...which you should.</p>

<h2>Uptown</h2>
<div class="info-image"><%= image_tag "uptown.jpg", alt: "Uptown" %></div>
<p>This is where we live! There's a bunch of good stuff around here. Here are a few:</p>

<ul class="restaurant-list">
  <li>
    <h3>Muddy Waters</h3>
    <p>If you're going to Uptown, definitely go here (we do all the time). Great beer list, good food, chill atmosphere. Not too pricey.</p>
    <p class="address">2933 Lyndale Ave S <br />Minneapolis, MN 55408</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <h3>Lyndale Tap House</h3>
    <p>Right next to Muddy Waters. They serve Pit Beef sandwiches. If you know what that is, you'll probably want to go there. 2-4-1 Happy Hour specials (on some drinks) daily before 6pm.</p>
    <p class="address">2937 Lyndale Ave S <br />Minneapolis, MN 55408</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <h3>Herkimer Pub and Brewery</h3>
    <p>The beer is OK...but its 2-4-1 for Happy Hour every day before 6pm, so there's that!</p>
    <p class="address">2922 Lyndale Ave S <br />Minneapolis, MN 55408</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <h3>French Meadow Bakery</h3>
    <p>Great bakery that also makes good brunch, lunch, and dinner.</p>

  </li>  
  <li>
    <h3>It's Greek To Me</h3>

  </li>  
  <li>
    <h3>Fuji Ya</h3>

  </li>
  <li>
    <h3>Origami</h3>
    <p>Also sushi!</p>
    <p class="address">1354 Lagoon Ave <br />Minneapolis, MN</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <h3>The Republic</h3>
    <p>Good food, great beer list. Get a beer flight, its an awesome deal. Nice location overlooking Calhoun Square (pictured above).</p>
    <p class="address"> 3001 Hennepin Ave #2200 <br />Minneapolis, MN 55408</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <h3>Chino Latino</h3>
    <p>Bad beer list but pretty good food apparently. They try to have items on their menu from places all over the world that straddle the equator.</p>

  </li>
  <li>

  </li>
  <li>
    <h3>Punch Pizza</h3>
    <p>A bit out of the way, but if you find yourself walking around the lakes you should totally stop here. It's in a random strip mall, but this is some of my favorite pizza. Don't mess around, just get the Margherita. I dare any East Coaster to not like this pizza. Fun Fact: Punch Pizza got a shout-out during this year's State of the Union address.</p>
    <p class="address">3226 W Lake St <br />Minneapolis, MN</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<br />
<h2>St. Paul</h2>
<div class="info-image"><%= image_tag "moscow.jpg", alt: "Moscow on the Hill" %></div>

<p>If you're looking to go into St. Paul (other than for the wedding) just go to <span class="content-link"><%= link_to "Moscow on the Hill", "http://moscowonthehill.com/" %></span> and get the Siberian Pelmeni. <span class="italic">Holy. Crap.</span> Really, really good.</p>
